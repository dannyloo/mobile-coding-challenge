https://api.unsplash.com/photos/curated/?client_id=55d34af08d928ec06dac447c8e11b58311734cc651f78f62029373afb74a5152
- Images are displayed in a grid format
- App works in both landscape and portrait and aspect ratio of the original image is displayed
- When user taps on a photo on the grid it should show only the tapped photo in full screen with more information about the 
photo
- When user swipes on a photo in full screen, it should show the the next photo and preserve current photo's location on 
the grid, so when she dismisses the full screen, grid of photos should contain the last photo she saw in photo details
